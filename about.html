    <h1>Who Is This Metalhead?</h1>

    <p>I'm a middle-aged man who lives in Michigan. I have a wife, two sons, a dog, and a cat.</p> 

    <h1>What I Love About Opera</h1>
    <p> 
        There are critics who get testy and haughty about older singers not hitting all the high notes.
        I don't care. Voices lose range as they get older. I olny care whether they can hit the notes 
        in whatever key they are singing, convey the feelings of the character in the scene.
        </p>
        <p>But I'm a regular fan who goes to opera to be enveloped in the experience of music, voice, and 
            performance.
