    <h1>Who Is This Metalhead?</h1>

    <p>I'm a middle-aged man who lives in Michigan. I have a wife, two sons, a dog, and a cat.</p> 

    <p>Read below for a quick guide to what I love about opera.</p>

            <td>The Voices</td>
            <td>They are powerful. Opera singers spend years training and working to peoject
                their voice so that everyone in a theater (some seat as many as 3800 people) 
                without the help of any amplification. And convey immense emotions. That's power.
            </td>
        <tr>
            <td>The Scale</td>
            <td>Opera is Over the Top. The stakes are always life-threatening and heart-breaking. 
                People are always falling in love at first site (La Boheme). Men are cursed to
                roam the seas for defying God (The Flying Dutchman).
