    <!--Welcome-->
    <h1>Welcome to the Metalhead's Guide to Opera</h1>
    <p>This guide is meant to for those are who curious about or new to opera. 
        I'm a Gen-Xer who was a metalhead during his teenage years and is now
        an avid fan of opera.

    <p>A couple of things to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have been attending live operas for 25 years.</li>
        <li>I am not a musician. Which means I can't read music, and can't tell when someone
            is singing in a key that is different from what is written in the score.
        </li>
        <li>I love opera.</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Enjoy</h1>
<p>Opera is an experience. There are many kinds of operas; humorous operas, sad operas, tragic 
    operas, and epic operas. Opera is over 400 years old. So there are operas and composers for everyone. Just because you like
    opera from one era does not mean you will like opera from another era or by a particular composer.
    There are opera fans who can't stand Baroque opera. There are opera fans who hate Richard Wagner. 
    All of that is okay. Opera is for everyone. But not every opera or composer appeals to everyone.</p>
<p>I want people to enjoy opera. No matter the language. It's a beautiful, passionate, exhilarating art form.
